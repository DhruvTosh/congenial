# OctoAcme Project Management — Overview & Index

This README is the central index for OctoAcme's project management process documents. It provides a concise summary of the way OctoAcme runs projects and links to each process document in this folder so contributors and stakeholders can quickly find procedures, checklists, and role guidance.

OctoAcme runs projects using an iterative, outcome-oriented lifecycle: Initiation, Planning, Execution, Release, and Retrospective. Each project is supported by a small set of core artifacts — a Project One-pager (charter), prioritized backlog and release plan, a risk register, and retrospective action items — that together make ownership, scope, and success metrics explicit. The approach emphasizes delivering small, testable increments, measuring outcomes, and iterating based on evidence.

Key workflows include a light but defined initiation process (one-pager and stakeholder alignment), planning that breaks work into shippable increments with clear acceptance criteria and a Definition of Done, and day-to-day execution on a project board (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done) with disciplined pull request practices and CI validation. Blockers are handled through a three-level escalation path (team → PM → sponsor) to expedite resolution.

Roles and communication are deliberate to reduce ambiguity: Project Managers coordinate delivery, schedules, risks, and status; Product Managers own outcomes, prioritization, and validation; Developers implement and test; QA validates acceptance criteria and release readiness; stakeholders provide input and approvals. Regular cadence includes daily standups for blocking issues, weekly delivery syncs, sprint/milestone demos, and monthly stakeholder updates. Quality assurance requires unit/integration tests, smoke tests for critical flows, CI security scanning, and pre-release checklists including rollback plans — all aimed at predictable, observable releases and continuous improvement.
